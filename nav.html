        <h2>Content One</h2>
        <p>The polar bear is a powerful marine mammal native to the Arctic region. Known for its thick white fur and insulating fat, the polar bear thrives in icy environments, relying on sea ice for hunting seals, its primary food source. The Arctic itself is a vast, frozen landscape characterized by extreme cold, glaciers, and unique wildlife like Arctic foxes and seals. Climate change poses a significant threat to both polar bears and the Arctic ecosystem, as melting ice reduces their habitat and hunting grounds.
        </p>
        <h3>Content Two</h3>
        <p>Polar bears face several significant threats, primarily due to climate change. As temperatures rise, the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is melting at an alarming rate. This forces polar bears to travel greater distances in search of food, often leading to malnutrition and decreased reproductive success. Additionally, the loss of ice habitat means polar bears are spending more time on land, where food is scarce. Pollution, such as chemicals and oil spills, also contaminates their environment, and human-wildlife conflicts can increase as polar bears venture closer to populated areas in search of food. These combined threats are putting polar bear populations at risk of decline.
